The challenge is to organize and join(merge) three spreadsheets from Colleges in Montreal. All three spreadsheets are different and some work is needed to normalize them.

Define the base columns. (Best option is the Concordia spreadsheet.
Insert College column.
Rename the names of the DataFrame columns (if necessary)
Delete some DataFrame columns (if necessary)
Organize DataFrame columns from trebas
Save the fina DataFrame on an xlsx file.

After that, just put your hands on it.
